# 100-Days-of-Machine-learning
100 Day ML Challenge to learn and implement ML/DL concepts ranging from the basics to more advanced state of the art models.
Finished machine learning concepts from Andrew NG's course by Standford University on Coursera.

# Daily logs:
## Day-1 [17-09-2021] Introduction:
* Started ["Machine learning- A Probabilistic Perspective" by Kevin Murphy.](http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/ECE228/Murphy_Machine_Learning.pdf)
* Introduction to machine learning- learnt about: Matrix completion, Image Inpainting, collaborative filtering, No free lunch theorem and Market Basket analysis.
* 4 Distance measures widely used in machine learning.

## Day-2 [18-09-2021] Regression Analysis:
* Started by solving a problem related to the previous day which involved KNN and MNIST Dataset.
* Learnt about different types of regression namely Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and Polynomial Regression.
* Each one with their Equations and Graphs

## Day-3 [19-09-2021] Support Vector Machines:

* Understood the intuition behind SVMs.
* Implemented a simple classification model using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) SVM for the [Bank-retirement](https://www.kaggle.com/adarshkumarjha/bank-customer-retirement) dataset available on Kaggle.

##  Day-4 [20-09-2021] Naive-Bayes:

* Understood the intuition behind Naive Bayes Classifier.
* Implemented a simple Naive Bayes Classification model using scratch for [Iris dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vikrishnan/iris-dataset) available on Kaggle.

## Day-5 [21-09-2021] Hyperparameter tuning:
* learnt the importance of hyperparameter tuning in machine learning algorithms.
* saw different parameters for SVMs, Naive Bayes and KNNs.
